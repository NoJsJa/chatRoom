# chatRoom
Javaweb project about chatRoom using Ajax,JQuery,Javascript,Jsp and Servelt.
This is my first complete Javaweb Project, not use any framework like Spring and so on, now i am working on it.
Something i have to say is that the best solution for web chatRoom is not Ajax long connection, 
this tech is too old, it's to use websocket, but i want to complete it without websocket, making chatting logic more complict.
next time i will use Spring and some front-end framework just like Bootstrap, 
because the css is so hard if i just write it by my hands that I think Bootstrap should be a useful tool. 

looking forward to my next project, using node.js, websocket, mongodb, Bootstrap ,AngularJS and Java Restful webservice.
