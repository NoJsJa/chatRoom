# chatRoom
Javaweb project about chatRoom using Ajax,JQuery,Javascript,Jsp and Servelt.
This is my first complete Javaweb Project, not use any framework like Spring and so on, now i am working on it.
Something i have to say is that the best solution for web chatRoom is not Ajax long connection, 
this tech is too old, it's to use websocket, but i want to complete it without websocket, making chatting logic more complict.

The total project include single-to-single chat, multi-chat and video-chat using websocket and nodejs as server side.
the nodejs server side is a Repository named 'node-video' in my Repositories, it's necessary to run it when you want to do a video chat in my chatRoom project.
